author: 'Tales Gomes'
excerpt: "Projeto desenvolvido para aquisição do certificado profissional em análise de dados, através da plataforma Coursera, sob a instrução da Google. Nele foram coletados, ao longo de 12 meses, dados acerca dos usuários membros assinantes do serviço oferecido pela empresa Bikeshare e usuários avulsos, de modo a identificar a diferença entre os dois grupos quanto a forma de utilização do serviço, visando à elaboração de recomendações para a equipe de marketing da empresa."

The director of marketing believes the company's future success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships. Therefore, your team wants to understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently. From these insights, your team will design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members. But first, Cyclistic executives must approve your ecommendations, so they must be backed up with compelling data insights and professional data visualizations.

## Ask Phase

[**Guiding questions**]{.ul}

7.  Are there any problems with the data?

    -   Yes, Some missing values, but it did not interfere with the analysis.

## Process Phases

### Ingesting and filtering the data

-   Ingesting the data using the [vroom](https://vroom.r-lib.org/articles/vroom.html) library and loading into the bikeshare_data.

```{r}
library(tidyverse) # used to filter the data
library(lubridate) #used to work with date class. 
library(reactable)

#loding the files name and 
files <- fs::dir_ls(path = "database/")
files

bikeshare_data <- vroom::vroom(files,
                               col_names = TRUE)


```

```{r}

head(bikeshare_data)


```

-   Filtering and Process the data using the tools in the [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/).

    -   In this fase we created the following variables:

        -   **trip_duration** - the trip duration in minutes;

        -   **weekday_day** - The day of the week the trip takes place;

        -   **is_weekend** - Test if the day is a weekend;

        -   **date_month** - Stores the month the trip takes place;

        -   **date_hour** - Stores the hour the trip takes place;

        -   **date_season -** Stores the season of the year;

        -   **day_time -** Stores the time of the day;

        -   **trip_route -** Stores the route of the trip (start station to end station).

    -   Then we keep the following variable:

        -   **start_station_name**;

        -   **ride_id**;

        -   **rideable_type;**

        -   **and member_casual.**

    -   the we exclude the remaning original variables.

    -   then we change the class of the categorical variables to factor.

    -   then we excluse the missing data;

    -   And finally, we filter the data to contain only trip duration longer than 0 minutes.

```{r}

         rideable_type = factor(rideable_type,

                            ordered = TRUE),
         day_time = factor(day_time, levels = c("dawn", "morning", "afternoon", "night"),

  drop_na(rideable_type:day_time) |> 
  filter(trip_duration > 0)
```

-   Checking the data

```{r}
glimpse(bikeshare_data)
```

## Analyse Phase

-   First, we analyze the data broadly to see patterns, then group it by user type to see differences.

```{r}

bikeshare_summary <- bikeshare_data |>
  Hmisc::describe()


bikeshare_summary

```

```{r}
summary(bikeshare_data$date_hour)
```

-   Analyzing the data generated by the "describe" function we can infer that:

    -   Regarding the type of bikes, "docked_bike" is more than 45% of all trips, followed by "classic_bike" with 28% and "eletric_bike" with 25%;

    -   Regarding to the type of user, "member" represents 56.7% while "casual" represents 43.3%;

    -   Regarding to the day, "weekend" represents 33.8% of the races with a peak on Saturday and a minimum on Monday;

    -   Regarding the time of day, it can be observed that the peak occurs at 17, 18 and 16 hours. The races decrease from afternoon, night, morning, until dawn.

    -   Regarding to the month and season, the values decrease from summer, spring, autumn to winter. With the busiest months being June, August and July and the least busy months being February, December and January;

    -   Regarding to the duration of the trip, the average duration is 26 minutes.

```{r}
options(reactable.theme = reactableTheme(
  color = "hsl(233, 9%, 87%)",
  backgroundColor = "hsl(233, 9%, 19%)",
  borderColor = "hsl(233, 9%, 22%)",
  stripedColor = "hsl(233, 12%, 22%)",
  highlightColor = "hsl(233, 12%, 24%)",
  inputStyle = list(backgroundColor = "hsl(233, 9%, 25%)"),
  selectStyle = list(backgroundColor = "hsl(233, 9%, 25%)"),
  pageButtonHoverStyle = list(backgroundColor = "hsl(233, 9%, 25%)"),
  pageButtonActiveStyle = list(backgroundColor = "hsl(233, 9%, 28%)")
))



bikeshare_skim_member <- bikeshare_data |> 
  group_by(member_casual) |> 
  skimr::skim()
  

reactable(bikeshare_skim_member, filterable = TRUE, paginationType = "jump", 
          columns = list(
  skim_type = colDef(
    cell = function(value) {
      htmltools::tags$b(value)
    }
  )
))

```

-   Regarding the difference in usage between members and casual users, we can observe the following:

    -   The trip duration is 170% longer for Casual Users. Averaging 40.1 min for casual users and 15.1 min for members;

    -   Regarding the type of bicycle, the most used for members, in descending order, are "docked", "classic" and "eletric". For casual users they are "docked", "eletric" and "classic";

    -   Regarding the time of year, both users follow the general average with a peak in summer and less use in winter;

    -   The busiest member months are June, August, September and July. For casual users, the busiest months are June, August, July and May;

    -   Regarding the day of the week, the busiest days for members, in descending order, are Wednesday, Saturday, Friday and Tuesday. For casual users, the busiest days are Saturday, Sunday, Friday and Wednesday. With greater usage of the service on weekends for casual members compared to members;

    -   Regarding the time of day both types of users have more runs in the afternoon, however in casual members the night is busier than in the morning.

-   The Stations and routes more often used are the following:

```{r}

## Act

### Key findings
 - Different of members, casual user use service more often during the weekend;
 - Also have the mean duration of the trips 170% higher than members;
 - They the highest trip duration during dawn (from 12 am to 5 am) and at night (from 9 pm to 11 pm). With the pic at 2 am;
 - During this time (from 9 pm to 3 am) the number of trips for casual users are higher than members;
 - Casual users use the service mor from may to september;
 - From june to september the have the highest trip duration in the year;
 - use more eletrics bikes thans members.
 
### Recommendations
 - Create a subscription based on time-of-day to encourage casual users that ride from 9 pm to 5 am to subscribe;
 - Implement discounts or a points system based on loyalty (frequency of use
) and high trip-duration users;
 - Create seasonal subscriptions such as summer and spring. Or implement discounts on temporary subscriptions (3, 6, 9, 12 months);
 - Create subscription especific to ride on week day or on the weekend;
 - Create subscriptions for specific types of bicycles. Plans to use only electric bicycles, for example.
